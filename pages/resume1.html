            <p>
                <span>What is a CV? </span>A CV—short for the Latin phrase “curriculum vitae” meaning “course
                of life”—is a detailed document highlighting your
                professional and academic history. CVs typically include information like work experience, achievements
                and awards,
                scholarships or grants you’ve earned, coursework, research projects and publications of your work. A CV
                is typically two
                or three pages long, but it’s not unusual for it to be much longer for mid-level or senior job
                applicants as it serves
                as a full outline of one’s career accomplishments.

                <span>What is Computer Science? </span>Computer Science is the study of computers and computational
                systems. Unlike electrical and computer engineers, computer
                scientists deal mostly with software and software systems; this includes their theory, design,
                development, and
                application.

            <p> <span>What is a database closure?</span> 1
                The closure is essentially the full set of attributes that can be determined from a set of known
                attributes, for a given
                database, using its functional dependencies. <br>
                <span> Formal math definition:</span> <br>
                Given a set of functional dependencies, F, and a set of attributes X. The closure is defined to be the
                set of attributes
                Y such that X -> Y follows from F.

            <p><span> What Does Candidate Key Mean?</span>
                A candidate key is a specific type of field in a relational database that can identify each unique
                record independently
                of any other data. <br>

                Experts describe a candidate key of having "no redundant attributes" and being a "minimal representation
                of a tuple" in
                a relational database table. <br>

                One of the most common questions around the use of a candidate key is how the candidate key relates to
                super keys and
                primary keys in database design.

            <p> <span>What Does Boyce-Codd Normal Form (BCNF) Mean?</span>
                Boyce-Codd Normal Form (BCNF) is one of the forms of database normalization. A database table is in BCNF
                if and only if
                there are no non-trivial functional dependencies of attributes on anything other than a superset of a
                candidate key. <br>

                BCNF is also sometimes referred to as 3.5NF, or 3.5 Normal Form.

                <span> What is C Programming Langauge?</span>
                C is a general-purpose programming language that is extremely popular, simple, and flexible to use. It
                is a structured
                programming language that is machine-independent and extensively used to write various applications,
                Operating Systems
                like Windows, and many other complex programs like Oracle database, Git, Python interpreter, and more.
                <br>
                It is said that ‘C’ is a god’s programming language. One can say, C is a base for the programming. If
                you know ‘C,’ you
                can easily grasp the knowledge of the other programming languages that uses the concept of ‘C’

                It is essential to have a background in computer memory mechanisms because it is an important aspect
                when dealing with
                the C programming language.
